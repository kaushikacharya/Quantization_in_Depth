# Introduction

- This course covers
  - Build and customize variants of linear quantization functions:
    - Choosing between two “modes”: asymmetric and symmetric
    - Three granularities: per-tensor, per-channel, and per-group quantization in pure PyTorch.
  - Hone your skills to understand when to use Quantization
  - Build your own quantizer in PyTorch, to quantize any open source model’s dense layers from 32 bits to 8 bits on any modality: text, vision or multimodal.
  - Go beyond 8 bits, and pack four 2-bit weights into one 8-bit integer.
